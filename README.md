# Magnetic Nanoparticles Imaging via YIG-based Magnetorelaxometry

This repository contains the scripts to reproduce the results presented in our paper: **"YIG-based magnetorelaxometry: Sensor Design, Fused Lasso Inversion, and Metrological Validation"**.

Our works introduces a novel **Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) magnetometer** system for **magnetorelaxometry (MRX)** imaging. The **Fused Lasso regularization** framework isproposed to solve the inverse problem and reconstruct the 3D spatial distribution of magnetic particle concentrations.
